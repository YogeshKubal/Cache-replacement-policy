1) Extract the .zip file in any particular location.
2) The .zip file contains the two .java codes: LRU_cache.java and ARC_cache.java, the two lis files: P3.lis and P4.lis and two script files: runP3.sh and runP4.sh.
3) Run the code from the same folder or if from any other location then copy all the contents to that particular location(all the 6 files).
4) Open the terminal and cd to the folder which holds the java codes and the script files to execute.
5) Type in the command sh ./runP3.sh to run the sample instances for P3.lis
   The .java files will automatically be compiled and run for 1024 and 2048 cache configs for P3.lis
   The results displayed will be for:
        LRU cache size 1024 for P3.lis
        ARC cache size 1024 for P3.lis
        LRU cache size 2048 for P3.lis
        ARC cache size 2048 for P3.lis
6) The program will execute on its own and display the outputs(hit ratio's) for each of the policies one after the other.
7) Similarly run the script file for P4.lis using the terminal command sh ./runP4.sh
   The .java files will automatically be compiled and run for 1024 and 2048 cache configs for P4.lis
   The results displayed will be for:
        LRU cache size 1024 for P4.lis
        ARC cache size 1024 for P4.lis
        LRU cache size 2048 for P4.lis
        ARC cache size 2048 for P4.lis
8) Match the results obtained with those in the paper.
